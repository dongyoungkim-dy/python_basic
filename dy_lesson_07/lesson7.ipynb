      "San Francisco’s decision to take the ball first in overtime during their Super Bowl loss to the Kansas City Chiefs will be debated all offseason. That scrutiny will be even stronger after some 49ers players admitted they weren’t aware of new rules regarding overtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, overtime ended as soon as one team scored. Then the rule was altered so both teams could possess the ball — unless the first team on offense scored a touchdown. In that case, the game would end on that TD, and that’s what happened when New England beat Atlanta 34-28 in Super Bowl 51.\n",

      "But the most recent rule change mandated that in the postseason, both teams can possess the ball even if the first offensive team scores a touchdown. Now NFL playoff overtime even more closely resembles the college OT format, where teams alternate possessions. And in college, teams often like to have the ball second because they’ll have a better sense of what they need on their drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, the 49ers took the ball in overtime and drove for a field goal, then lost 25-22 when Patrick Mahomes guided Kansas City 75 yards the other way for the winning touchdown on Sunday night. If they’d known three points wouldn’t be good enough, they could have gone for a touchdown in that spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, Kansas City had that advantage, which meant the Chiefs had no choice but to go for it on fourth-and-one from their own 34, down three. They converted and eventually reached the end zone on a three-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Mecole Hardman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s something we talked about,” San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said. “None of us have a ton of experience of it.”\n",

I didn’t even realize the playoff rules were different in overtime,” fullback and Harvard graduate Kyle Juszczyk said. “I assume you just want the ball to score a touchdown and win.
